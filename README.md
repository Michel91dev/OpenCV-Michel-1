# OpenCV-Michel-1
 
 I'm a Mac user and this project is for Mac
⚠️ for M2 (Arm) Mac Processor, you'll need to activate the Rosetta option on the Xojo App (in the finder options of the App) 

I'm using Friolator Project "https://github.com/friolator/xojo-opencvc"
as a base for this Xojo Project.
I will use it to learn basically and I'm really an early "amateur" so I'm not sure if this is can be useful for anyone.

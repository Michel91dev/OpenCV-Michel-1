# OpenCV-Michel-1

I'm using Friolator Project "https://github.com/friolator/xojo-opencvc"
as a base for this Xojo Project.
I will use it to learn basically and I'm really an early "amateur" so I'm not sure if this is can be useful for anyone.

 I'm a **Mac** user and this project is for Mac
 
⚠️ in the original project the "libOpenCVC.dylib" build option is set to "INTEL", this got me crazy for several hours until (with the help of a friend) I saw this. **It has to be set to "Universal"**, specially if you own a M1/M2 (ARM) Mac Processor ⚠️

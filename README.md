# OpenCV-Michel-1

I'm using Friolator Project "https://github.com/friolator/xojo-opencvc" (Many thanks for all this great work)
as a base for this Xojo Project that I will make evolve to learn the usage of OpenCV with Xojo on Mac.
I'm not sure if this is can be useful for anyone... üôÑ

 I'm a **Mac** user and this project is for Mac
 
‚ö†Ô∏è in the original project the "libOpenCVC.dylib" build option is set to "INTEL", this got me crazy for several hours until (with the help of a friend) I saw this. **It has to be set to "Universal"**, so M1/M2 (ARM) Mac Processor user can also use it ‚ö†Ô∏è
